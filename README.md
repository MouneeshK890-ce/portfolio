# 🌐 Personal Portfolio — Mouneesh

This is my personal portfolio website, built to showcase my projects, skills, and learning journey as a frontend developer.  
The site was generated initially using **Lovable.ai**, and I customized it by adding new components, updating content, and adjusting the layout and styling to match my profile.
